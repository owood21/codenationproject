    <h1>Selecting and using IT systems and software how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h1>
<br></br>

<p> The way I would go about selecting and using IT systems and software is I would do my research 
    into different IT systems and see which is the best IT system and do the weighting up of the 
    pro and cons and make my choice on that and then for the software I would see if it compatible 
    with the its system and making sure it meets my needs. </p>
