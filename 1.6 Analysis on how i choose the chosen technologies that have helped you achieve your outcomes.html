<p> The chosen technologies I used were Visual studio code, Microsoft word and trello. 
    Visual studio code help me create my blog as it was a platform that uses java script, CSS and html coding language all in one place. 
    Microsoft word is another chosen technology as this helped my get all my grammar correct before pasting it into the body of the website.
