  <h1>  Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate e.g. Visual Studio Code, Code-pen, Trello</h1>
<p> The IT tools selected were appropriate because without code pen I would struggled to head my head 
    around all the different coding languages as I have never done coding before so this helped me get
     an understanding. Visual studio code is appropriate because this is where I will be creating my 
     website as I can bring all 3 coding languages together in one programme. Trello is an appropriate
      tool to use when creating a website as it can help with time management
